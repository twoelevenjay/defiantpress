# defiantpress
This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope that Defiant will find the developer they need, and that developer would be me. When activated you will randomly see a Defiant team member in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. Although I took inspiration from the first WordPress plugin ever, "Hello Dolly", every line of code is original and authored by me***. *** I used 3rd party dependencies for the web crawler. These are all located in the dependencies directory.
