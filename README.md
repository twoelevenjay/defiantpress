# defiantpress
This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope that Defiant will find the developer they need, and that developer would be me. When activated you will randomly see a Defiant team member in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.  ALthough I took insopiration for the first Wordpress plugin ever, "Hello Dolly", every line of code is original and authored by me.
