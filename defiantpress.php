 * The plugin init file.

 * @package DefiantPress
 * @version 1.7.2
 *
 * Plugin Name: DefiantPress
 * Plugin URI:  https://github.com/twoelevenjay/defiantpress
 * Description: This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope that Defiant will find the developer they need, and that developer would be me. When activated you will randomly see a Defiant team member in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. Although I took inspiration from the first WordPress plugin ever, "Hello Dolly", every line of code is original and authored by me.
